    <h3>Terms & Conditions — Authorized Authorities</h3>

    <div class="terms-box">

      <h2>1. Authorized Access Only</h2>
      <p>
        Access to P.E.P.P.E.R’s authority panel is strictly limited to verified government agencies,
        law enforcement bodies, disaster management authorities, and approved partner organizations.
        Credentials are non-transferable.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Purpose-Bound Usage</h2>
      <p>
        The platform shall be used only for official purposes such as locating missing persons,
        disaster response, or lawful investigations. Any personal, political, or unauthorized use
        is strictly prohibited.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Human Verification Mandate</h2>
      <p>
        All AI-generated matches, signals, or similarity scores are assistive outputs only.
        Final identification, confirmation, and action must be performed by authorized human officials.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Confidentiality & Handling</h2>
      <p>
        All accessed data is confidential and classified. Authorities must ensure secure handling,
        storage, and usage of data in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws.
      </p>

      <h2>5. No Automated Decision-Making</h2>
      <p>
        P.E.P.P.E.R does not provide automated decisions. Any operational or legal decision taken
        based on system output lies entirely with the authorized authority.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Audit & Logging</h2>
      <p>
        All actions performed within the authority interface are logged, timestamped, and auditable.
        Activity logs may be reviewed for compliance, security, and accountability.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Accountability & Liability</h2>
      <p>
        Authorized entities are solely responsible for outcomes resulting from the use or misuse
        of the platform. P.E.P.P.E.R shall not be held liable for actions taken by authorities.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Access Suspension & Revocation</h2>
      <p>
        P.E.P.P.E.R reserves the right to suspend or revoke authority access in cases of misuse,
        policy violation, security risk, or legal non-compliance.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Legal & Ethical Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        Authorities must operate within local, national, and international laws,
        including human rights, privacy, and data protection regulations.
      </p>

      <h2>10. System Integrity</h2>
      <p>
        Any attempt to tamper with system logs, bypass safeguards, extract unauthorized data,
        or reverse-engineer the platform will result in immediate access termination
        and potential legal action.
      </p>
